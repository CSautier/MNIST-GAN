This project is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to simulate MNIST digits.

The first code (mnistGan.py) is a basic GAN trying to simulate any digit.

The second code (number_generation.py) allows to train a model to write each number specifically, so that you can have an algorithm creating digits as if written by hand.

It uses random seeds to generate the digits differently each time.
